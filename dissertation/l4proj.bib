abstract = {Although traditionally associated with defence and security domains, radar sensing has attracted significant interest in recent years in healthcare applications. These include the monitoring of vital signs such as respiration, heartbeat, and blood pressure, analysis of gait and mobility levels, classification of human activities to promptly detect critical events such as falls, as well as the evaluation of fitness and reactivity levels. The attractiveness of radar against alternative technologies such as wearable sensors or cameras lies in its contactless capabilities, whereby people do not need to wear, carry, or interact with any additional device, and plain images of people and private environments are not recorded. In this letter, we discuss some of the most recent achievements and outstanding research challenges related to radar applications in healthcare and present some results from our work at the University of Glasgow, including a dataset of radar signatures of human activities that are openly shared with the wider community.},

abstract="In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing about an individual should be learnable from the database that cannot be learned without access to the database. We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy.",

abstract = "Many services based on human activity recognition (HAR) have been developed; however, user activity data include a large amount of private information. Although privacy protection is important in activity recognition, it has not been sufficiently explored. Therefore, we propose a privacy-preserving mechanism for HAR services that uses differential privacy. The proposed method reduces the user recognition accuracy to a level that satisfies the privacy requirements by adding weighted noise to the features in the learning model construction and then improves the activity recognition accuracy (service usefulness). The results indicate that when the privacy requirement is defined as less than the probability of a user being identified by chance, the proposed method improves the activity recognition accuracy by approximately 10 % compared to the conventional method.",

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable devices have become ubiquitous and interconnected in daily lives. Because wearable devices collect, transmit, and monitor humans’ physiological signals, data privacy should be a concern, as well as fully protected, throughout the whole process. However, the existing privacy protection methods are insufficient. In this paper, we propose a practical privacy-preserving mechanism for physiological signals collected by intelligent wearable devices. In the data acquisition and transmission stage, we employed existing asymmetry encryption-based methods. In the data publishing stage, we proposed a new model based on the combination and optimization of k-anonymity and differential privacy. An entropy-based personalized k-anonymity algorithm is proposed to improve the performance on processing the static and long-term data. Moreover, we use the symmetry of differential privacy and propose the temporal differential privacy mechanism for real-time data to suppress the privacy leakage while updating data. It is proved theoretically that the combination of the two algorithms is reasonable. Finally, we use smart bracelets as an example to verify the performance of our mechanism. The experiment results show that personalized k-anonymity improves up to 6.25% in terms of security index compared with traditional k-anonymity, and the grouping results are more centralized. Moreover, temporal differential privacy effectively reduces the amount of information exposed, which protects the privacy of IoT-based users.},

abstract = {The pervasiveness of location-aware devices has spawned extensive research in trajectory data mining, resulting in many important real-life applications. Yet, the privacy issue in sharing trajectory data among different parties often creates an obstacle for effective data mining. In this paper, we study the challenges of anonymizing trajectory data: high dimensionality, sparseness, and sequentiality. Employing traditional privacy models and anonymization methods often leads to low data utility in the resulting data and ineffective data mining. In addressing these challenges, this is the first paper to introduce local suppression to achieve a tailored privacy model for trajectory data anonymization. The framework allows the adoption of various data utility metrics for different data mining tasks. As an illustration, we aim at preserving both instances of location-time doublets and frequent sequences in a trajectory database, both being the foundation of many trajectory data mining tasks. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-life data sets suggest that the framework is effective and efficient to overcome the challenges in trajectory data anonymization. In particular, compared with the previous works in the literature, our proposed local suppression method can significantly improve the data utility in anonymous trajectory data.}

ABSTRACT = {Device-free indoor identification of people with high accuracy is the key to providing personalized services. Visual methods are the solution but they require a clear view and good lighting conditions. Additionally, the intrusive nature leads to privacy concerns. A robust identification and classification system using the mmWave radar and an improved density-based clustering algorithm along with LSTM are proposed in this paper. The system leverages mmWave radar technology to overcome challenges posed by varying environmental conditions on object detection and recognition. The point cloud data are processed using a refined density-based clustering algorithm to extract ground truth in a 3D space accurately. A bi-directional LSTM network is employed for individual user identification and intruder detection. The system achieved an overall identification accuracy of 93.9% and an intruder detection rate of 82.87% for groups of 10 individuals, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Although traditionally associated with defence and security domains, radar sensing has attracted significant interest in recent years in healthcare applications. These include the monitoring of vital signs such as respiration, heartbeat, and blood pressure, analysis of gait and mobility levels, classification of human activities to promptly detect critical events such as falls, as well as the evaluation of fitness and reactivity levels. The attractiveness of radar against alternative technologies such as wearable sensors or cameras lies in its contactless capabilities, whereby people do not need to wear, carry, or interact with any additional device, and plain images of people and private environments are not recorded. In this letter, we discuss some of the most recent achievements and outstanding research challenges related to radar applications in healthcare and present some results from our work at the University of Glasgow, including a dataset of radar signatures of human activities that are openly shared with the wider community.},
